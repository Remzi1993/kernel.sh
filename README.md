# kernel.sh
Compiling the Linux Kernel from source made easy!

## Download and execute the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Remzi1993/kernel.sh/master/kernel.sh
bash ./kernel.sh
```

Or you could give the bash script execute permission and run it afterwards like this:
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/kernel.sh
./kernel.sh
```
